# PCA Returning Applicant Project
My goal for this project is to create a showcase of who I am and what I've done over the past year by writing out a depiction of
the previous year in my Bio section, as well as show what I've done with my hobbies and interests since the last round of PCA interviews.

## Tier 1 Targets: Project Components
- The project will be developed with Vite, utilizing React.js and Tailwind CSS
- Included will be sections about my hobbies of reading and learning, as well as music I currently love (as well as photos of my son throughout)

## Tier 2 Targets: JS Interactivity
- Clickable buttons or 'books' that display the relevant review
- Additional click events to use image gallery

### Tier 3 Targets: Dynamic Elements
- I followed [Monsterlessons Academy's video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK9AlIbexOE&pp=ygUibW9uc3RlciBhY2FkZW15IHJlYWN0IGltYWdlIHNsaWRlcg%3D%3D) to implement an image slider.
- I dynamically displayed my own not-archived repositories in the Portfolio section of the project using GitHub's API.
