# PCA Returning Applicant Project
My goal for this project is to create a showcase of who I am based on what I read. I am going to attempt to convey my interests and personality based on favorite reads or genres, and favorite albums. This is the initial outline, all is subject to change.

Run Instructions: The goal is for this to be deployed to GitHub pages, and should be linked here on the repo.

## Tier 1 Targets: Project Components
- The project will be developed with Vite, utilizing React.js and Tailwind CSS
- It will include a brief introduction, followed by (hopefully) thematic bios that go more into detail about my hobbies/interests and what I love

## Tier 2 Targets: JS Interactivity
- Clickable buttons or 'books' that reveal the relevant blurb about me
- Hover effects and animations
- 

### Tier 3 Targets: Dynamic Elements
- Maybe a little carousel of my favorite books?  Open Library API?
- It would be cool to incorporate Spotify's API in some way to convey my current favorite albums?
