        review: "As good as the fantasy genre gets, in my opinion. No one writes characters like Joe Abercrombie, and I love good characters. This is the third book in a trilogy, which is based on the idea - what if we re-did Lord of the Rings but Gandalf was an asshole?"
    }, {
        id: 2,
        title: "Man's Search for Meaning",
        path: Meaning,
        review: "Both a real account by a psychologist who survived Auschwitz, and his psychological theories that followed. This book shows you just how much mindset matters, and that finding meaning in what you do is important."

        title: "The Molecule of More",

        review: "Enjoyable to read and teaches you about how dopamine fuels your drive, addictions, and self-control. A rare fun to read nonfiction."

        title: "Sea of Tranquility",

        review: "Quick-hitting SciFi that poses big questions and captures the feelings of isolation and time passing by during the COVID lockdown using time travel and four different interwoven plot threads."

        title: "The Secret History",

        review: "I think this is Vonnegut's masterpiece. A man with PTSD from his involvement in the firebombing of Dresden trips through time. This book asks 'Does anything really matter?' It's a dark comedy."

        id: 7,
        title: "The Will of the Many",

        review: "Fantasy Anicent Rome with a great magic system, world-building that sucks you in, with flawed yet compelling characters. A bunch of story-telling tropes in one story, but all flawlessly executed."
